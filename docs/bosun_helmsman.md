## bosun helmsman

Deploys a helmsman to a cluster. Supports --dry-run flag.

### Synopsis

This command has environmental pre-reqs:
- You must be authenticated to vault (with VAULT_ADDR set and either VAULT_TOKEN set or a ~/.vault-token file created by logging in to vault).
- You must have kubectl installed and have a context defined for the cluster you want to deploy to.
- You must have helm installed.
- You must have helmsman installed. (https://pkg.com/Praqma/helmsman)

The {domain} argument is the domain the services in the helmsman will be available under (e.g. n5o.green or n5.blue).
The {helmsman-files} argument is the path of the helmsman files to pass to helmsman.

You must set the --apply flag to actually run the helmsman (this is to prevent accidents).


```
bosun helmsman {helmsman-file} [additional-helmsman-files...} [flags]
```
