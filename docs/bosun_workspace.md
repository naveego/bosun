## bosun workspace

Workspace commands configure and manipulate the bindings between app repos and your local machine.

### Synopsis

A workspace contains the core configuration that is used when bosun is run.
It stores the current environment, the current release (if any), a listing of imported bosun files,
the apps discovered in them, and the current state of those apps in the workspace.
The app state includes the location of the app on the file system (for apps which have been cloned)
and the minikube deploy status of the app.

A workspace is based on a workspace config file. The default location is $HOME/.bosun/bosun.yaml,
but it can be overridden by setting the BOSUN_CONFIG environment variable or passing the --config-file flag.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for workspace
