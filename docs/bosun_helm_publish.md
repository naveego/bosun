## bosun helm publish

Publishes one or more charts to our helm repo.

### Synopsis

The [chart-path] parameter defaults to ./ 

If chart-path ends in a * (like devops/charts/*) this command will publish
each chart in the folder, and will not error if the chart has already been published.

If multiple charts paths are provided, each will be published and it will not 
error if the chart has already been published. 


```
bosun helm publish [chart-paths...] [flags]
```
